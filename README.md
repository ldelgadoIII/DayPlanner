# DayPlanner

## Website Summary

Welcome to my website where you can use this day planner to plan out your day! You have the ability to type in and save items within every text box. Deleting the text and saving the box will leave the box empty when you reload the page. The current date and time is displayed at the top of the screen. Depending on the time of day, the colors of the text boxes will change accordingly. So if the time has passed then the boxes will be greyed out. Creating this planner really helped me understand using local storage, accessing data within an object array, and utilizing jquery to specifically grab information with clicks. To improve this page I would improve the design, add multiple days, and include a completed button to reset the text field.
